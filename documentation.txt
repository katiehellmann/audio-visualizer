II. Tell us about the 2 Audio Effect nodes you added to the audio routing graph:
I added the bass and treble nodes, which both distort the audio.

III. Tell us your Sprite's class name, what it looks like/what it does in the visualization:
sprite.js is the file that contains all my sprite data. It creates images that dynamically increase/decrease in size based on the music.

IV. Tell us what app data you put in your av-data.json file
My JSON file contains title info, song info (including song name, artist, and tracktime), as well as information about the starting state.

V. Tell us how you improved the aesthetics of the app over the AV HW:
The theme of my project is Chappell Roan. I included a picture of her on the left side of the screen, three tracks from her album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, changed the bar colors to be rainbow and changed the circles method to instead display a heart. 
I also altered the font and added some additional CSS to resize the canvas to fit on smaller screens to better match my chosen theme. I would give myself a 13% in this section, since I didn't move the controls or make them more appealing using CSS.
